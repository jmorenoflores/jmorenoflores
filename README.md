# Hi there, I'm Javier and Welcome to my profile!    

## Intro

I am a Data Scientist with two years of experience using Python and SQL. I have a track record of using analytical skills to drive data-driven decision making across 17 projects involving statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. I completed the professional training certificate program in Data Science through Practicum and am now seeking a new opportunity to leverage my experience and enhance analytical processes.

## Skilled using the following skills/libraries: 
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, seaborn)
- Parsing Data (BeautifulSoup, re, requests)
- Machine Learning Hyperparameter Tuning (Sklearn, random/gridSearchCV)
- Time Series Analysis (seasonal_decompose, TimeSeriesSplit, DateTime)
- Natural Language Processing (spaCy, NLTK, PyTorch, TfidfVectorizer)
- Unsupervised machine learning (K-Means, IsolationForest)
- Computer Vision (TensorFlow, Keras)
- PostgreSQL
- Audio Feature extraction using Librosa

I am also experienced, with two years, in developing dietary calculators, using Excel, for epileptic patients in the Precision Ketogenic Program at the University of Florida. I am eager to apply my previous experiences to improve and optimize analytical processes and data-driven decisions.
